# Custom RPM macros configuration file for building RPM packages
# as a non-root user.


# The %_smp_mflags macro usually contains only the -j (â€“jobs) option for
# the make command, which define seotfhe number of jobs (make commands) that
# may run simultaneously. Usually, this is set to the number of CPU cores
# plus one. So, on a dual core CPU, the smp flags are set to -j3.
%_smp_mflags  -j3 


# The %__arch_install_post macro contains various checks that should be
# run on the files in the BUILDROOT location. I trust Fedora guys and
# use the defaults check-rpaths and check-buildroot on Fedora and CentOS.
# This macro is optional.
